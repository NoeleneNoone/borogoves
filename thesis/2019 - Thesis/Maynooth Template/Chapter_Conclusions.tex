\section{Summary}
Summary of the work in general and in each chapter comers here.

\section{Future Works}
Here I describe how this work can be extended.

** Social testing
In future work we shall assess the framework behaviour in relation to in-house defect deferral rates and the number of field defects raised.


** Social dogfood

In subsequent work we shall assess our framework in conjunction with each feature component, to understand which
components are most likely to break once released into the field. This future work can aid micro teams and SMEs to
continuously pivot to further reduce defect detection rates from customers within the field. \par

** Outage modelling


** Outage simulation


** Chat discourse modelling

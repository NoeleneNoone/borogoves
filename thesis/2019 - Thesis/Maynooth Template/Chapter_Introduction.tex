\section{Motivation}
Before the advent of the Cloud and rapid software release models, software was developed and delivered to customers via a method called Waterfall. Waterfall is a non-iterative design process used in software development. One of the disadvantages of Waterfall was the time taken from development, test and delivery to the customer (i.e. a release every 12 to 35 months).

With the broad adoption of consumer computing in the 1990s, customer demand precipitated a move away from Waterfall to a leaner ``little and often'' approach. Agile development introduced the concept that a team should have a feature or component ready for release at periodic stages during its development cycle. The adoption of agile development practices allowed for incremental releases to made at a much faster rate.

A refinement of agile came about with the round-the-clock availability of Cloud computing and services. Cloud computing adopted the practice of using a network of remote servers to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. With the ``always available'' paradigm, new development practices were required. A new development model known as continuous delivery (CD) was created. CD differs from agile development in that development teams develop software that is ready for release at any time during development.

Delivering software for the Cloud represents a challenge for both micro teams, Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and startups, in part due to the rapid release methods (i.e. CD) adopted and the numerous ways in which software defects can be detected. 

Likewise, as applications are hosted on a Cloud-based infrastructure, production outages (critical software defects) can occur in a variety of ways due to the complex nature of distributed computing.

Furthermore as small teams adopt real-time collaborative instant messaging solutions to collaborate on defect remediation, making sense of this data can be a challenge to teams, given the lack of inbuilt analytical tooling.

We extend previous work by studying field defect, production outage events and real-time collaboration data. Through empirical research on a myriad of enterprise and open-source datasets, we provide a series of frameworks that can be used to turn endless streams of data into high-value information.

\section{Overview}
This thesis is divided into the following chapters:

\textbf{Chapter 1: Introduction}

This is introductory chapter and broad discussion of the context that in part motivates this proposed work.

\textbf{Chapter 2: Literature Review}

For the literature review chapter, background and related research are reviewed and discussed.

\textbf{Chapter 3: Social Testing}

This chapter presents two studies of software testing conducted as part of the release of a Cloud-based enterprise application. The concept of social testing is introduced, and we demonstrate how this idea can be used to reduce field defects.

\textbf{Chapter 4: Outage Modelling}

This chapter discloses details of a study conducted into Cloud outages, using an enterprise dataset. Both outage inter-arrival and services are modelled.

\textbf{Chapter 5: Outage Simulation}
In this chapter, we take the inter-arrival and service times from our Cloud outage study and simulate the arrival of future outages events. From this simulation staffing requirements to manage such events can be inferred. 

\textbf{Chapter 6: Chat Discourse Modelling}

This chapter presents a framework that can be used to model real-time chat discourse using both parametric and non-parametric methods. 

\textbf{Chapter 7: Chat Discourse Segmentation and Boundary Identification}

This chapter also presents a novel technique to segment chat conversations to provide an improved degree of summarisation. We also consider a text classification framework to identify chat conversation boundaries. 

\textbf{Chapter 8: Conclusions}

This last chapter summarises the key findings, learning outcomes and pathways for future work.
